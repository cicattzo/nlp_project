Advanced NLP Project

Project outline:

1. Preprocessing - use https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WIk2bxglElfZewOHboPFNj8H44_VAyKE?usp=sharing#scrollTo=3FO5ESocXvlK and https://github.com/dailykirt/ML_Enron_email_summary/blob/master/notebooks/Process_Emails.ipynb to write our own preprocessor
2. Apply several models to the context of bodies, namely:

  2.1. BERT (Abstractive Summarization)
  
  2.2. GPT-2 (Abstractive Summarization)
  
  2.3. BERT (Extractive Summarization) https://pypi.org/project/bert-extractive-summarizer/
  
  2.4. Fine tuning with already pretrained models (Abstractive Summarization)
  
3. Write Evaluation with BLEU and some other scores
4. Write report (We need to write from 12 to 14 pages in ACL)
